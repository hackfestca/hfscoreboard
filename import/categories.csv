inject,Sisyphus,"[Injection track] (Regex, JCR SQL2, SOLR, MongoDB). <br/>
<p>This is a simplified version of the HF2k16 injection track. That is there is no more difficulty selection and less server side validation to mess with your injection attempts. </p>
<p>You must search for the flags in the different datastore. Each flag have the format specified by the following regex /FLAG-[a-f0-9]{32}/. Still in the scoreboard you <em>ONLY</em> submit the flag value without the ""FLAG-"" prefix</p>
<p>For each type of injection, there are three stages: <ul><li>Not blind</li><li>Blind</li><li>Blind + filtered</li></ul></p>
<p>Hints: <ul><li>Use the not blind injection stage to test your payload for the other stages</li><li>JCR SQL2 &lt;&gt; SQL thus SQLmap won't work</li><li>Read the specs of each Query language</li><li>The FLAG- prefix is key to solve some of the injection stages</li></ul></p>

password,Password Cracking,"This track wants to develop abilities to build your own wordlists to crack passwords with various methods. It’s been mostly adapted to focus the challenge on the techniques rather than the computing power. Explore the various contexts and go as if someone said “I want to tell you a story”. Scrape <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100017569505854"";""Wayne Day's Facebook profile"">Wayne Day’s Facebook</a>, expand your dictionary on other pages (I’d suggest no further than 2-3 links deep from Facebook page contents or researching it) following these contexts, having more unique words, build wordlists and crack with the usual techniques. Bruteforce may help you, but isn’t the preferred way. Less usual techniques may be required for medium+ difficulty levels, including wordlist manual tampering! Be creative.
Instructions : Cracking evident passwords may be too easy, but it is required for those that never cracked before, to see the progress. To mitigate that, the easy level requires THREE (3) cracked hashes per flag, medium level needs TWO (2) and hardcore+ ones only require ONE (one), as we don’t expect you to find those easily =). Say you found the 3 hashes associated with easy1, and the passwords were password1, password2, pasword3, the password for easy1.zip would be password1password2pasword3. MD5 hashes are made with echo -n password | md5sum
IMPORTANT : Due to Facebook limitations, some parts of a profile cannot be visible to public non-Facebook visitors….therefore it’s required to have a Facebook account or to create a throwaway one. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6aGOgkNZj1-TjdTeU9oSml3VUk?usp=sharing"">HASH</a>",FALSE,vn
