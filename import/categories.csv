inject,Sisyphus,"[Injection track] (Regex, JCR SQL2, SOLR, MongoDB). <br/>
<p>This is a simplified version of the HF2k16 injection track. That is there is no more difficulty selection and less server side validation to mess with your injection attempts. </p>
<p>You must search for the flags in the different datastore. Each flag have the format specified by the following regex /FLAG-[a-f0-9]{32}/. Still in the scoreboard you <em>ONLY</em> submit the flag value without the ""FLAG-"" prefix</p>
<p>For each type of injection, there are three stages: <ul><li>Not blind</li><li>Blind</li><li>Blind + filtered</li></ul></p>
<p>Hints: <ul><li>Use the not blind injection stage to test your payload for the other stages</li><li>JCR SQL2 &lt;&gt; SQL thus SQLmap won't work</li><li>Read the specs of each Query language</li><li>The FLAG- prefix is key to solve some of the injection stages</li></ul></p>
