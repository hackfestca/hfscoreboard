<h3>Instructions:</h3>

Build weapons of mass destructions (WMD) and then try to use them from the inside against the enemy. Attackers can build as many WMD as they want. WMD will be dropped one at the time in the order they are produced. WMD are dropped at a rate of 1 per 30 seconds. EACH AND EVERY WMD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS i.e.: If your team drop 100 ineffective WMD before an effective one, you will have to wait for 50 minutes before your effective WMD get dropped.

<h4>How to see the result of your WMD:</h4>

For some of the flag listed below, you will need to make a call to the &quot;getFlag&quot; JavaScript function take will be loaded automatically in your page context. A call to this function will succeed if you were able to achieve what it is listed in the flag description. Upon success a 
cookie named flag will be defined in the page context containing the flag value.
<br/>

<em><h4>***Warning***:</h4></em><ul>
<li>WMD length is limited to 4000 characters. Over 4000 characters, WMD will be truncated.</li> 
<li>To prevent brute force, if a call to &quot;getFlag&quot; fails, the current WMD will be countered. The next submitted WMD will be dropped within the next 30 seconds.</li>
<li>From the inside you will only be able to reach your team subnet (172.28.1XX.0/24), the tracks subnet and the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet.</li>
<li>For performance considerations, dynamic creation of DOM elements have been disabled</li>
<li>For performance considerations, simultaneous ressources requests have been limited to 500. Over 500, requests will be dropped.</li>
